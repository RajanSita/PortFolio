                <h3>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)</h3>
                <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies, Pitampura</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2024 - Present</p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies, Pitampura. This program has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of computer science and software development. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience, I am learning to develop, test, and maintain software applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>The curriculum includes courses in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, web development, and database management systems. These subjects have equipped me with the necessary skills to design and develop software solutions that are both efficient and scalable. I have also had the opportunity to work on various projects as part of my coursework, which has helped me apply my learning in practical settings.</p>
                <p>In addition to the core subjects, the program also emphasizes the importance of communication skills, teamwork, and project management. These skills are essential for any software developer, as they enable me to work effectively in a team and manage projects from inception to completion. The supportive learning environment at Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies has encouraged me to explore new areas of technology and continuously improve my skills.</p>
                <p>As I continue my studies, I am particularly interested in deepening my knowledge of web development and exploring emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am committed to making the most of my time in this program to build a solid foundation for my future career as a software developer.</p>
