                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am Rajan, a passionate Software Developer based in New Delhi, India. My journey in technology started during my school days at <a href="https://skrpublicschool.org/">S.K.R.Public School</a>, where I discovered my love for coding. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at <a href="https://www.vips.edu/">Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies, Pitampura.</a>This course has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science and software development, allowing me to work on diverse projects that help solve real-world problems.</p>
                    <p>My expertise lies in front-end development with a focus on creating intuitive and dynamic user interfaces. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have a working knowledge of Python, which I use to develop backend functionality for web applications. I am constantly learning and staying updated with the latest technologies to enhance my skill set and deliver cutting-edge solutions.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about contributing to the community. One of my notable projects is the "Divyang Disha Seva Trust" website, designed to assist disabled individuals by connecting them with volunteers and facilitating donations. I am also proud of my "Personal Finance Manager" project, which empowers users to manage their finances efficiently.</p>
                    <p>I am driven by the desire to create impactful software that improves people's lives. As I continue my academic and professional journey, I aspire to work on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you would like to collaborate!</p>
